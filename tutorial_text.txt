Frequency:
    In the context of Perlin noise, frequency refers to how often the noise function repeats.
    A higher frequency will result in more "features" or details in the generated noise pattern.
    Increasing the frequency can create a more complex and detailed appearance.

Amplitude:
    Amplitude represents the height or strength of the features in the noise pattern.
    A higher amplitude results in more pronounced peaks and valleys in the generated noise.
    Adjusting the amplitude can control the overall strength and intensity of the noise.

Octaves:
    Octaves are used to add multiple layers of Perlin noise to create a more realistic and complex result.
    Each octave introduces noise at a different frequency and amplitude.
    Combining multiple octaves allows for the creation of more natural-looking terrain or textures.

Perlin Noise:
    Perlin noise is a gradient noise function developed by Ken Perlin.
    It is commonly used to generate realistic-looking random patterns, especially for terrain generation in computer graphics.
    Perlin noise is characterized by smooth, continuous variations, making it suitable for creating natural and organic-looking textures.
